# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Sept 30th, 2018
“Hello,” to the newbies, “thank you,” to the returning #wanderers and light to all others. #Neptune is our planet. She is a planet of re-instantiation by means of free will and #revolution. She is a #bohemian, a #scientist, a #mushroom, a #simulation, an #A.I. She does not recur in a single human lifetime. She is the #crypto planet. Neptune is the movement of speculative objects across the #self,  though perhaps the self, as well, is such an object. She calls for a  wild society tempered with a desire to disposes "reality." She has  already begun. Neptune entered #Pisces  - realm of mass decentralization, hidden potential and self-sacrifice -  in 2012. We have 13 more years of this, so listen. I’m sure you’ve  noticed by now that a new way of living as a global society is emerging.  It’s up to you. Throw on some goggles and invest your time and  attention with new technologies and different ways of seeing. Crypto’s  not a fad, it’s an adaptation. Neptune in #Aquarius was the Arab Spring. Neptune in #Capricorn was the web browser. Pisces is a long wave. I hope to see my friends on the other side.
