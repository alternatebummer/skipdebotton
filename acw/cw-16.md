# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Feb. 11th, 2019
What a mystery. A #schrodinger's CEO. 200 million comes down to a laptop. Here’s a hot take. If your #crypto game doesn’t start with free, #endtoend transactions designed and deployed by #FOSS allies, then I’m sorry, it’s not a game you can win. #Bitcoin, #Ether, #Litecoin - what it is doesn’t matter if you don’t use it right. Where have I been? How’s my mental health? I see the #Sun is about to straddle #Pisces and #Aquarius. I want you to focus on the #future, not the #past. #Uranus and #Mars break bread in the House of #Selfhood, but by early March they’ll both be in #Taurus. Time to roll some .44% #THC. It’s new leaf time and the #piper’s come for his #pound of #flesh. You’re going to need uncompromised #psychoaction or the numbers won’t #hodl. In May we can relax. What’s it like in deep #space? What have I learned after marathon #floats? If you aren’t cold storing your own crypto, it may as well be on Gerald #Cotten’s laptop. You still need investment advice this week? Switch to #Kalilinux. Security starts at home.
