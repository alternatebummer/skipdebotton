## Oct. 17, 2018

I know we’ve all been talking about #stablecoins and whether or not Ethereum will #zero #out. Meanwhile, #Mercury entered #Scorpio  on the 9th. That meant air your drama. That meant we needed to talk  about the difference between information and actual substance. Intention  matters, but the #ontological roots of #things are saturated by consequence, not intention. Did you #divest? I’ll be honest. I almost did. How does your body feel? Do you have #safe #harbour  for one more night? Mercury in Scorpio means nothing is too taboo, so  let’s be real - you are not your portfolio, nor the  You are a witness  enfolded in a process of becoming over time. You are a cocktail of  information and substance rooted in consequence. Study up. Get back on #breakfast. #Smoke #weed, #meditate,  do what you have to do to get in touch with your body. What affects  your sense of well-being? Take inventory. Fam, you have no idea how much  I’m looking forward to #Sun in Scorpio on the 23rd. We will discuss that further as the week progresses.
