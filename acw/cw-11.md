# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Oct. 24th, 2018
The #Sun has entered #Scorpio. To some, this is a relief. The death of a sovereign idea can be that way. It can be that way when a spent universe receives #Shiva. "The universe ends with me and never ends,” she says, but when she blinks you are nothing but a #carbon #pile. All the same, #Brahma awakens. For humans born today, with their Sun in Scorpio and their #Uranus #opposed in #Taurus, we have the makings of a technologically driven #survivalist. I think we can agree that the higher mind around us is collapsing. These babies will use #freefall as #bathwater and prosper in ways we have not yet imagined.  And we remember that Uranus is a #crypto planet in the sign of the #bullrush.   It’s time to look around and move forward with exactly what we have.  What are the terms? What are *your* terms? Not a shred of shade exists  at all between the planets of the inner solar system today. Isn't it  also true that the lustre of dividend smart contracts is fading? Most #ICOs today still aren't hiring astrologers. Consult your chart and let’s use what we have to die in a graceful pattern. And it’s #rebirth  time, so keep an eye on this new batch of Scorpios. We know not yet  what alien gallery they inherit from us, nor how it will be used.
