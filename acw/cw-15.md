# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Nov. 26th, 2018
I'll say it, I miss #Oumuamua already. Is it a #probe? An #earthship? From #Lyre to #Pegasus, with our own #Sun as the go-between. Wowie gee. Right now she's somewhere between #Jupiter and #Saturn  moving at 38.8 km/s, her orbit around the galactic core having been  permanently altered by the visit. Omuamua's passing reminds us that #leaving is itself a lesson. Remember that Lyre is the constellation of #Hermes' #harp. In other words, an instrument of the messenger. But I'm too bummed out to draw any conclusions. Not even #margin #trading is cheering me up. Even the sweet #satisfaction that comes from breaking out of the 9-to-5 grind is like sand in my mouth this week. I need a cold #shower or some #bacon.
