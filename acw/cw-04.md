# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Sept 9th, 2018
A silence is left with the passing of #Mars in #Capricorn to #Aquarius on Sept. 10th. What moves in that silence? #Retrograde #Pluto in Capricorn apparates a deep #maze. Not every #block is on the #chain, my friends. Itâ€™s time to be #Theseus. Go down and shed light on the habits that shape your choices. Whose #weak #hands are these? Also in Capricorn: #Saturn. The planet of #humility, #aftermath and #hodling. Our decision-making conforms when we collaborate with #machines. If you #traced your #decisions to their #origin, would you expect to find a #minotaur? We will sway back to a world of #tanking #coins on the 29th (when Pluto goes #station #direct).
