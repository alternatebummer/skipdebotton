# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Nov. 11th, 2018
Look between #Sagittarius and #Scorpio tonight. #Jupiter looms benevolent like #DRM-free #ebooks, like #gains. She is a philosopher in the extreme, and an unwavering friend. Her second face is oriented toward the #Milky #Way’s galactic core. She observes—with black-eyed avian courage—a region within the core said to contain a supermassive #black #hole known as Sagittarius *A. That’s Jupiter for you. #BlockchainEXPO 2018 is just weeks away. The air is tensing up with mental energy. If you find an opportunity in the #brush while you’re #cutting #trail, pay it #time and #attention. #Mars in #Aquarius and #Uranus #retrograde in #Aries  is hunger setting in. It’s hunger from too much of the same, compelling  us toward our involuntary, intuitive nature and our real desires. We  are #bears at the stream and we will instantiate #fish without delay. Watch for movement and #engage. Life is #doomed. Always was. We can see doom with both faces.
