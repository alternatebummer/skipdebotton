# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Oct. 5th, 2018
It's #venus going #station #retrograde today in the 8th house. Time to wake up. Do you neglect the potential of #XRP?  Maybe it’s enough to acknowledge that you have been giving it your  attention this whole time, just not giving it your respect. Venus now  has the inward momentum of reparations, accountability and #progressive change. And it happens to be opposed #Uranus retrograde in #Taurus. Uranus is a slow mover, but because its retrograde takes it back into #Aries  from Taurus we all have something imperative to discuss. We’re gearing  up for a boom in Taurus, but the 1st house will reset the Uranian energy  of #polyphonic  change and liberation through technology/higher-order thinking with  Arian skepticism. Time to reset, says the 1st house. Time to  second-guess first appearances. On the other side of the chart, we know  it’s time to own our disquiet. We will find ourselves cutting #deep #trail  into exactly what emotional and intellectual technologies are causing  alarm in our lives. Act. Put out your fires. Light some new ones.  Retrograde is not regression. It’s a chance to listen, to upgrade, and  eventually to set a new course. #Probe the #polyphony and get back to me.
