# ARCANE CRYPTO WATCH
## Sept 5th, 2018
This month begins and ends with a #moon in #Cancer. We can play around all we want, but the truth is that we should be locking. it. down. this month, ALL month. #Balance those investments. Put on a clean #altcoin shirt and throw out that #old #sushi. Call your #mentors. Write down the collectivist ideology of your new #ICO before the #DMT fades completely and you forget what we've all been living and dying for out here on #planet #Earth.  And if you can't get your game together, don't worry. Our Cancer moon,  she returns at the end of the month to blast us all with one final  inward push. You are more than your #dividends. Don't settle for being part of someone else's plan.
